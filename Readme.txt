In order to avoid merging conflicts when updating scenes, I have created our own copies of the "Master" scenes for you to do your own development on titled "Scene.YourName". 
Please do your development on these scenes within preferably your own branch in Git and your personal scenes.
Only push Major/Needed changing to the Master, otherwise just keep commits within your own branch.
Once a week (or more frequently when needed), we will discuss a way to update our "Scene.Master" and update the master repository.

Please take the time to watch the following video on using sourcetree.
